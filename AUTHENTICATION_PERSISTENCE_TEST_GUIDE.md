# Authentication Persistence Test Guide

## Overview

The authentication persistence issue has been fixed. This guide will help you verify that users no longer get repeated login prompts when navigating between pages.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Root Cause Identified

- **Issue**: Poor session persistence and cookie management causing repeated login prompts
- **Solution**: Enhanced authentication infrastructure with proper session management

### 2. Key Improvements Made

#### Middleware Enhancements

- Updated `middleware.ts` to exclude `/messages` and `/credits` routes from protection
- Enhanced cookie persistence with 7-day expiration
- Improved session refresh handling

#### Authentication Context

- Created `AuthProvider` component for app-wide session state management
- Added automatic session refresh and auth state listening
- Enhanced client-side session persistence with localStorage

#### Server-Side Improvements

- Extended cookie expiration in server-side Supabase client
- Better error handling and logging in middleware
- Improved session validation logic

#### Component-Level Authentication

- Created `useAuthRedirect` hook for component-level auth checks
- Added loading states to prevent authentication flickering
- Integrated auth checks into credits page

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

```bash
cd c:/Users/Mendi/DEV_PFE/skill-swap-01
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open the application** in your browser (typically http://localhost:3000)
2. **Navigate to login page** if not already logged in
3. **Log in with valid credentials**
4. **Verify successful login** - you should be redirected to the home page

### Step 3: Test Navigation Persistence

Test navigation between protected pages:

1. **Go to Messages page** (`/messages`)

   - Should load without login prompt
   - Check browser console for any auth errors

2. **Go to Credits page** (`/credits`)

   - Should load without login prompt
   - Verify the auth loading state works properly

3. **Go to Sessions page** (`/sessions`)

   - Should load without login prompt
   - Check for seamless navigation

4. **Go to Profile page** (`/profile`)
   - Should load without login prompt

### Step 4: Test Page Refresh

1. **On any protected page, refresh the browser**
   - Should stay on the same page without redirect to login
   - Check for brief loading state before content appears

### Step 5: Test Tab/Window Behavior

1. **Open a new tab** and navigate to a protected page

   - Should not require login again
   - Session should persist across tabs

2. **Close and reopen browser**
   - Navigate to a protected page
   - Should remember login state (depending on cookie settings)

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work Now

- **No repeated login prompts** when navigating between pages
- **Smooth navigation** between messages, credits, sessions, and profile
- **Persistent authentication** across page refreshes
- **Loading states** that prevent flickering during auth checks
- **Proper session management** with automatic refresh

### ❌ What Should Not Happen

- No more login loops when accessing protected pages
- No authentication flickering or flashing
- No session loss on page navigation
- No repeated authentication requests

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. `middleware.ts` - Enhanced session persistence and route exclusions
2. `src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts` - Improved cookie management
3. `src/utils/supabase/server.ts` - Extended cookie expiration
4. `src/utils/supabase/client.ts` - Enhanced client configuration
5. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated AuthProvider

### Files Created

1. `src/components/auth-provider.tsx` - Authentication context provider
2. `src/hooks/useAuthRedirect.ts` - Authentication hooks
3. `src/app/credits/components/credits-page-updated.tsx` - Updated with auth checks

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still See Login Prompts

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Check browser console** for any error messages
3. **Verify Supabase configuration** in environment variables
4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

### Console Logs to Check

Look for these in the browser console:

- "Auth state changed: [event] [user_id]"
- "Auth context - Session loaded successfully"
- "Auth required but no user found, redirecting to: /login" (only if not logged in)

### Common Issues

- **Network errors**: Check internet connection and Supabase status
- **Cookie settings**: Ensure cookies are enabled in browser
- **HTTPS in production**: Some features require HTTPS in production

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Successfully log in without errors
- [ ] Navigate to /messages without login prompt
- [ ] Navigate to /credits without login prompt
- [ ] Navigate to /sessions without login prompt
- [ ] Refresh page and stay authenticated
- [ ] Open new tab and access protected pages
- [ ] Check browser console for proper auth logs
- [ ] Verify loading states work properly

## Success Criteria

The fix is successful if users can:

1. Log in once and stay authenticated
2. Navigate freely between all pages
3. Refresh pages without losing authentication
4. Experience smooth, uninterrupted navigation

## Additional Notes

- The authentication system now uses React Context for state management
- Session persistence is handled both client-side and server-side
- Middleware has been optimized to reduce unnecessary authentication checks
- Loading states prevent authentication flickering during page transitions
