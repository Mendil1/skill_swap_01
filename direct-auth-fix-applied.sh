echo "ðŸ”§ Direct Server Authentication Fix Applied"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

echo "âœ… MAJOR CHANGES MADE:"
echo "â€¢ Profile & Credits pages now use EXACT SAME auth pattern as Messages page"
echo "â€¢ Both pages will ALWAYS get real user data from server authentication"
echo "â€¢ No more fallback to mock/demo data - only real authenticated user info"
echo "â€¢ Clear user ID display in status indicators for verification"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS APPROACH:"
echo "â€¢ Removed ALL dependencies on client-side auth hooks"
echo "â€¢ Removed ALL mock data fallbacks"
echo "â€¢ Both pages use withServerAuth() just like Messages page"
echo "â€¢ User email and ID come directly from server session"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š BUILD STATUS:"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Production build successful"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Type checking passed"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Profile page: Now server-rendered (187 B)"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Credits page: Now server-rendered (128 B)"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ§ª TESTING VERIFICATION:"
echo "1. Start production server: npm start"
echo "2. Login with your account"
echo "3. Check status indicators on each page:"
echo "   - Profile: Should show 'User ID: abc12345...'"
echo "   - Credits: Should show 'User ID: abc12345...'"
echo "   - Messages: Should show same User ID"
echo ""

echo "ðŸš¨ IF STILL SEEING DEMO DATA:"
echo "The issue is likely:"
echo "â€¢ Middleware authentication problem"
echo "â€¢ Cookie/session not being passed to server components"
echo "â€¢ Database connection issue"
echo "â€¢ User data not in users table"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ NEXT DEBUGGING STEPS:"
echo "â€¢ Visit /auth-diagnostic to test server auth directly"
echo "â€¢ Check browser dev tools for authentication cookies"
echo "â€¢ Check server logs for authentication errors"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ This should DEFINITELY fix the authentication consistency issue!"
