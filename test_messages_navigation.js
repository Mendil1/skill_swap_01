📋 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

2. Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000

3. Login with any existing user (e.g., pirytumi@logsmarter.net)

4. Click on "Messages" in the navigation bar

5. Expected behavior:
   ✅ Should navigate to /messages page
   ✅ Should show the Messages interface with tabs
   ✅ Should NOT redirect to login page

6. If it still redirects to login:
   - Check browser console for middleware logs
   - Clear browser cookies and try again
   - Check if you're properly logged in

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Removed /messages from middleware protected routes
- Let the page handle its own authentication
- This prevents middleware redirect conflicts

🎯 ROOT CAUSE:
The middleware was intercepting /messages requests and redirecting
to login due to cookie detection issues, but the page itself
has proper auth checks that work correctly.
