# SkillSwap Development Changelog

## April 21, 2025 - Connection Request & Messaging Systems

Today we completed two major features that enable direct interaction between users: the connection request system and the real-time messaging system. These features represent a significant milestone as they transform SkillSwap from a directory into a fully interactive platform.

### 1. Connection Request System

- Implemented a complete connection request workflow with multiple states: none, pending-sent, pending-received, accepted, and rejected
- Created a dynamic ConnectionButton component that adapts its UI and functionality based on connection status
- Added real-time status updates with loading indicators during state transitions
- Integrated toast notifications for connection actions (send, accept, reject)
- Implemented proper database schema with connection_requests table tracking sender, receiver, and status

```tsx
// Dynamic connection button that changes based on relationship status
switch (connectionStatus) {
  case "none":
    return <Button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect</Button>;
  case "pending-sent":
    return (
      <Button variant="outline" disabled>
        Request Pending
      </Button>
    );
  case "pending-received":
    return (
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <Button variant="outline" onClick={handleReject}>
          Decline
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={handleAccept}>Accept</Button>
      </div>
    );
  // Additional states...
}
```

### 2. Real-time Messaging System

- Built a comprehensive messaging interface with real-time updates using Supabase Realtime
- Implemented message grouping by date with clear visual separators
- Added read indicators and timestamp displays for each message
- Created smooth scrolling behavior with automatic scroll for new messages
- Added visual indicators for unread messages when users are scrolled up
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Optimized message input with character count and submission feedback

```tsx
// Real-time message subscription
realtimeChannel
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "INSERT",
      schema: "public",
      table: "messages",
      filter: `connection_id=eq.${conversationId}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle new message...
      setMessages((currentMessages) => [...currentMessages, payload.new]);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### 3. Conversation Management

- Created a conversation list that displays all active connections

## Notes

The connection and messaging features now enable users to:

1. Send connection requests to potential skill exchange partners
2. Accept or decline incoming connection requests
3. Engage in real-time conversations with accepted connections
4. Manage multiple conversations through an intuitive interface

These features complete the core interaction loop of the platform, allowing users to not just discover potential skill exchange partners but to actually connect and communicate with them.

## April 13, 2025 - Enhanced Search & Profile Features

Today we significantly improved the skills search functionality and profile management experience. These enhancements make the platform more usable and provide a richer experience for users seeking to exchange skills.

### 1. Enhanced Skills Search Functionality

- Added pagination for both skills and user search results
- Optimized server-side filtering for more efficient database queries
- Created a PaginationLink component to handle navigation between result pages
- Added visual indicators for search result counts in tab headers

```tsx
// Client-side search form with loading states
export default function SearchForm() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  // ...
  return (
    <Button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
      {isLoading ? (
        <>
          <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
          Searching...
        </>
      ) : (
        "Search"
      )}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### 2. Skill Categorization System

- Implemented a comprehensive skill categorization system with 10 predefined categories
- Added color-coded visual styling for different skill categories
- Enhanced the skill form to support category selection

```tsx
// Skill categories implementation
const SKILL_CATEGORIES = [
  "Technology",
  "Arts & Crafts",
  "Music",
  "Sports",
  "Languages",
  "Academics",
  "Cooking",
  "Business",
  "Health & Fitness",
  "Other",
];
```

### 3. Improved Skill Descriptions

- Added support for detailed skill descriptions in the skill form
- Implemented "Show more/Show less" toggles for long descriptions

- Updated the database queries to fetch and store description metadata

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

- Improved user cards in search results with better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Limited display of skills with "+X more" indicators to prevent overflow
- Added hover effects and improved button styling
- Implemented responsive layouts for better mobile experiences

```tsx
{
  user.offered_skills.length > 3 && (
    <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-white">
      +{user.offered_skills.length - 3} more
    </Badge>
  );
}
```

### 5. Profile Page Improvements

## Notes

The search and profile features are now complete, allowing users to:

1. Register and manage their profiles with detailed information
2. Add skills they can teach or want to learn with rich descriptions
3. Search for other users based on skill matches or user names
4. View detailed profiles of potential skill exchange partners

The next phase will focus on enabling users to connect with each other and arrange skill exchange sessions.

## April 12, 2025 - Auth System Updates & Next.js 15.3 Compatibility

Today we made several important updates to the authentication system and fixed compatibility issues with Next.js 15.3.0. These changes significantly improved the stability and user experience of the auth flow.

### 1. Fixed Next.js 15.3 SearchParams Handling

- Updated the login page to properly handle search parameters according to Next.js 15.3 requirements
- Implemented proper message parameter handling with URI decoding
- Used a type-safe approach for handling potential string or string array parameters

```typescript
// Next.js 15.3 compliant searchParams access
const messageParam = searchParams?.message;
const message = Array.isArray(messageParam)
  ? decodeURIComponent(messageParam[0])
  : messageParam
  ? decodeURIComponent(messageParam)
  : undefined;
```

### 2. Improved Supabase Cookie Handling

- Updated Supabase server client configuration to use the new `getAll()` and `setAll()` methods required by Next.js 15.3
- Added proper security headers for cookies (httpOnly, sameSite, secure)
- Fixed cookie management for better session handling and stability

```typescript
cookies: {
  getAll() {
    return cookieStore.getAll().map(cookie => ({
      name: cookie.name,
      value: cookie.value,
    }))
  },
  setAll(cookies) {
    cookies.forEach(({ name, value, ...options }) => {
      cookieStore.set({
        name,
        value,
        ...options,
        httpOnly: true,
        sameSite: 'lax',
        secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      })
    })
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Auth User Interface

- Implemented a tabbed interface to clearly separate login and signup flows
- Added password validation with real-time feedback
- Improved error messages for better user guidance
- Applied visual indicators for validation errors

### 4. Fixed Signup Process

- Improved email redirection URL handling with fallbacks for different environments
- Added more descriptive error messages from Supabase authentication
- Fixed URL encoding for error and success messages
- Added support for additional user metadata during signup

### 5. Auth Callback Route

- Created a proper OAuth callback handler to support the complete authentication flow
- Implemented session exchange for authentication codes
- Added appropriate error redirects

### 6. Middleware Updates

- Simplified route protection for authenticated pages
- Updated middleware configuration to avoid unnecessary static asset checks
- Improved auth state checking using the latest Supabase auth API

### Next Steps

- Complete user profile functionality
- Build out the skills management system
- Implement the matching algorithm for connecting users with complementary skills

## Notes

The authentication system now properly supports:

1. Email/password sign up with appropriate validation
2. Email confirmation flow
3. Login with existing credentials
4. Protected routes for authenticated users only

All error messages are now more descriptive and user-friendly, and the system is fully compatible with Next.js 15.3's stricter dynamic API handling requirements.
