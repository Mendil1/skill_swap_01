# Production Authentication Test - Quick Fix Guide

## Quick Test Instructions

Since you're experiencing repeated login prompts in production mode (`npm run start`), here's a targeted test to verify our fix:

### Step 1: Start Production Server

```bash
cd /c/Users/Mendi/DEV_PFE/skill-swap-01
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Step 2: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open browser** to http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** with your credentials (pirytumi@logsmarter.net)
3. **Navigate between pages** in this order:
   - Home → Messages
   - Messages → Credits
   - Credits → Sessions
   - Sessions → Profile
4. **Refresh each page** after navigating to it

### Step 3: Check Console Logs

Open browser developer tools and look for these logs:

**✅ Good signs:**

- `[Middleware] Allowing /messages route to handle its own auth`
- `[Middleware] Allowing /credits route to handle its own auth`
- `[Middleware] Allowing /sessions route to handle its own auth`
- `[AuthProvider] User authenticated successfully`

**❌ Problem indicators:**

- Multiple redirects to `/login`
- `[AUTH_FAILURE] User not authenticated`
- Authentication errors or loops

## Core Fix Applied

### 1. Middleware Enhancement

The middleware now allows `/messages`, `/credits`, and `/sessions` routes to handle their own authentication instead of forcing redirects:

```typescript
// Production-specific route handling - be more permissive
if (
  pathname.startsWith("/messages") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/credits") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/sessions")
) {
  console.log(`[Middleware] Allowing ${pathname} route to handle its own auth`);
  return response;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced AuthProvider Integration

The existing `AuthProvider` in `src/components/auth-provider.tsx` now works better with production builds because the middleware is less restrictive.

### 3. Client-Side Authentication Context

Your pages now rely more on the client-side authentication context rather than server-side redirects, which works better in production.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ What Should Work Now:

- **Login once**: No repeated login prompts
- **Smooth navigation**: Between all protected pages
- **Page refreshes**: Stay authenticated
- **Production mode**: Same behavior as development

### ❌ If Still Having Issues:

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

## Troubleshooting Commands

If you still see issues, run these diagnostics:

```bash
# Check if build completed successfully
cd /c/Users/Mendi/DEV_PFE/skill-swap-01
npm run build

# Check for environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

## Simple Test Script

Create this test in your browser console after logging in:

```javascript
// Test navigation persistence
async function testAuthPersistence() {
  console.log("Testing authentication persistence...");

  // Check current auth state
  const { user } = window.__NEXT_DATA__?.props?.pageProps || {};
  console.log("Current user:", user?.id || "No user found");

  // Test page navigation
  const pages = ["/messages", "/credits", "/sessions"];

  for (const page of pages) {
    console.log(`Testing navigation to ${page}...`);
    window.location.href = page;
    // Wait and check if redirected to login
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (window.location.pathname === "/login") {
        console.error(`❌ Redirected to login when accessing ${page}`);
      } else {
        console.log(`✅ Successfully accessed ${page}`);
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
}

testAuthPersistence();
```

---

**The key fix is that the middleware is now more permissive for the problematic routes, allowing the client-side authentication context to handle authentication instead of forcing server-side redirects.**
