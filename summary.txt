# SkillSwap Project Summary

## Project Overview
SkillSwap is a web application that facilitates skill exchange between users. The platform enables users to share their expertise and learn new skills from others in a collaborative environment. The core concept revolves around users offering skills they can teach while seeking skills they want to learn, creating a balanced ecosystem of knowledge exchange.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.3.0 (React 19)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 with additional UI components from Radix UI
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time features
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Custom UI components built with Radix UI primitives
- **Notifications**: Sonner for toast notifications

## Core Features
Based on the product backlog and implemented code:

1. **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and secure session management using Supabase auth
2. **User Profiles**: Creation and management of user profiles with personal information and skills
3. **Skill Management**: Users can add skills they offer and request, categorized appropriately
4. **Search Functionality**: Search for specific skills or users to find relevant matches
5. **User Connections**: Send and receive connection requests to initiate skill exchanges
6. **Messaging System**: Chat functionality between connected users to coordinate exchanges
7. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new requests, messages, and other activities
8. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Accessible on various devices with responsive design

## Database Structure
The application uses a relational database structure with the following key tables:
- **users**: Stores user account and profile information
- **skills**: Master list of available skills with categories
- **user_skills**: Junction table linking users to their offered/requested skills
- **connection_requests**: Manages connection status between users
- **messages**: Stores chat messages between connected users
- **notifications**: Handles system notifications for users
- **sessions**: For scheduling one-on-one skill exchange sessions
- **reviews**: Stores ratings and feedback between users

## Project Architecture
- **App Router**: Utilizes Next.js App Router for routing and layouts
- **Server Components**: Makes use of React Server Components for improved performance
- **Authentication Middleware**: Secures routes requiring authentication
- **Supabase Integration**: Uses Supabase client libraries for both client and server data access
- **Component Structure**: Well-organized component hierarchy with reusable UI components
