# Production Authentication Test Instructions

## Issue: Port 3000 Already in Use

You have a process already running on port 3000 (likely the development server). Here are your options to test the production authentication fix:

## Option 1: Use Different Port for Production Testing

```bash
cd /c/Users/Mendi/DEV_PFE/skill-swap-01
PORT=3001 npm run start
```

Then test at: http://localhost:3001

## Option 2: Stop Current Development Server

If you have `npm run dev` running in another terminal:

1. Find the terminal window running the dev server
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
3. Then run: `npm run start`

## Option 3: Kill Process on Port 3000 (Windows)

```bash
# Find the process ID
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process (replace XXXX with the actual PID)
taskkill /PID XXXX /F

# Then start production server
npm run start
```

## Authentication Test Steps

Once you have the production server running:

### 1. Open Browser

Navigate to: http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001 if using different port)

### 2. Login

Use your credentials: pirytumi@logsmarter.net

### 3. Test Navigation (The Critical Test)

Navigate between these pages **in production mode**:

- Home → Messages ✅ (should NOT prompt for login)
- Messages → Credits ✅ (should NOT prompt for login)
- Credits → Sessions ✅ (should NOT prompt for login)
- Sessions → Profile ✅ (should NOT prompt for login)

### 4. Test Page Refresh

- Refresh any protected page
- Should stay authenticated (no redirect to login)

### 5. Monitor Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:

**✅ Good signs (fix working):**

- `[Middleware] Allowing /messages route to handle its own auth`
- `[Middleware] Allowing /credits route to handle its own auth`
- `[Middleware] Allowing /sessions route to handle its own auth`
- `Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN [user-id]`

**❌ Problem signs (fix needs adjustment):**

- Multiple redirects to `/login`
- `[AUTH_FAILURE] User not authenticated`
- Authentication loops

## What the Fix Does

The production authentication fix makes the middleware **less restrictive** for the problematic routes:

```typescript
// Before: Middleware forced server-side auth checks (caused loops)
// After: Let pages handle their own authentication using AuthProvider

if (
  pathname.startsWith("/messages") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/credits") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/sessions")
) {
  console.log(`[Middleware] Allowing ${pathname} route to handle its own auth`);
  return response; // No redirect, let page decide
}
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:

- Login once, stay logged in across all pages
- No repeated authentication prompts
- Smooth navigation between protected pages
- Console shows middleware allowing routes to handle auth

### ❌ If Still Having Issues:

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Check that environment variables are properly set
- Verify the build completed successfully (which it did!)

## Quick Verification Command

To verify your production server is ready:

```bash
# Check if production build exists
ls -la .next/static/

# Should show build files if successful
```

**The production build was successful and the authentication fix is ready for testing. Choose one of the port resolution options above and test the authentication flow.**
