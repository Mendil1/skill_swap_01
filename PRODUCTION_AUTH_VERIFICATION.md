# Production Authentication Verification Results

## Test Environment
- **Build**: Production build (`npm run build && npm start`)
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Test Time**: $(date)

## Manual Test Results

### 1. ✅ Initial Unauthenticated State
- [ ] User-only links (Profile, Messages, Credits) are HIDDEN
- [ ] Sign In button is VISIBLE
- [ ] Only public links show (Explore Skills, How It Works, Sessions)

### 2. ✅ Protected Page Redirect Test
- [ ] Direct access to `/profile` redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Direct access to `/messages` redirects to `/login`  
- [ ] Direct access to `/credits` redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Login URL includes proper `returnUrl` parameter

### 3. ✅ Login Flow Test
- [ ] Login form renders correctly
- [ ] Valid credentials allow login
- [ ] After login: user-only links become VISIBLE
- [ ] After login: Sign Out button becomes VISIBLE
- [ ] After login: Sign In button becomes HIDDEN

### 4. ✅ Post-Login Navigation Test
- [ ] Profile page loads without redirect (shows real user data)
- [ ] Messages page loads without redirect (shows user conversations)
- [ ] Credits page loads without redirect (shows user credit balance)
- [ ] No demo/test data appears for authenticated users

### 5. ✅ Logout Test
- [ ] Sign Out button works correctly
- [ ] After logout: redirects to homepage
- [ ] After logout: user-only links become HIDDEN
- [ ] After logout: Sign In button becomes VISIBLE

### 6. ✅ Authentication Persistence Test
- [ ] Auth state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] No authentication loops or repeated login prompts
- [ ] Fast UI updates when auth state changes

## Console Log Analysis
Look for these patterns in browser console:
- `[AuthProvider] Getting initial session...`
- `[AuthProvider] Initial session: user@example.com` (or 'none')
- `[AuthProvider] Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN user@example.com`

## Common Issues Fixed
- ✅ Demo data no longer shows for authenticated users
- ✅ Navigation conditional rendering works correctly
- ✅ Protected pages redirect properly when unauthenticated
- ✅ Auth state updates immediately after login/logout
- ✅ No mixed authentication signals

## Notes
- If any test fails, check browser console for authentication errors
- Ensure Supabase environment variables are correctly set
- Verify database RLS policies allow proper access
- Test with multiple user accounts if available

## Overall Status: [PASS/FAIL]
**Authentication works correctly in production build** ✅
