# Additional Performance Optimizations

## Latest Performance Improvements (May 30, 2025)

### 1. Throttling & Caching Optimizations
- Increased notification cache expiry from 120s to 300s (5 minutes)
- Increased notification throttling from 60s to 120s
- Increased polling interval from 180s to 300s (5 minutes)
- Increased network monitor check interval from 120s to 300s
- Improved notification debounce time from 500ms to 1000ms

### 2. Component Optimizations
- Applied React.memo to critical components (FallbackImage, NavigationProgress, OptimizedLink)
- Added useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary recreations
- Optimized event listeners to reduce memory leaks
- Fixed null/undefined handling in notification components
- Conditionally loaded NetworkMonitorWrapper only for authenticated users

### 3. Image & Asset Optimizations
- Added priority loading for above-the-fold images
- Enhanced FallbackImage component with better loading strategies
- Added unoptimized option for data URLs

### 4. Next.js Config Optimizations
- Removed console logs in production builds (except errors/warnings)
- Increased static page generation timeout for better reliability
- Added 'standalone' output option for better server performance
- Optimized memory usage with onDemandEntries settings

### 5. Enhanced Performance Monitoring (May 30, 2025)
- Added comprehensive Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
- Implemented performance metrics collection and storage
- Created interactive performance dashboard for developers
- Added long task detection and reporting
- Tracked slow resource loads to identify bottlenecks
- Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P) to toggle performance panel

### 6. Offline Capabilities with Service Worker (May 30, 2025)
- Implemented service worker for offline functionality
- Added cache strategies tailored to different resource types
- Created background sync for pending notifications
- Added update notification system for new service worker versions
- Implemented proper error handling for offline scenarios

### 7. Data Fetching Optimization with React Query (May 30, 2025)
- Implemented React Query for global data fetching management
- Created optimized notification hooks with automatic caching
- Added optimistic updates for better user experience
- Implemented proper stale time and cache time configurations
- Created enhanced notification component with React Query integration

## Impact on Performance
- Significantly reduced unnecessary API calls
- Decreased component re-rendering frequency
- Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP) with prioritized image loading
- Enhanced Time to Interactive (TTI) with optimized JavaScript bundles
- Reduced memory usage with better cleanup of event listeners and timers
- Added offline functionality for better user experience
- Improved data fetching efficiency with React Query caching
- Enhanced developer experience with better performance monitoring

## Technical Implementation Notes
- All optimizations were made without breaking existing functionality
- Type safety was maintained throughout the optimization process
- Memory leaks were addressed in event listeners and timers
- Performance-critical components were memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Service worker implementation follows best practices for offline experiences
- React Query implementation provides a pattern for future data fetching needs

## Future Considerations
- Implement predictive prefetching for likely user navigation paths
- Add real user monitoring (RUM) for production performance tracking
- Consider implementing component-level code splitting
- Further optimize image loading with next/image best practices
- Add Intersection Observer for better lazy loading of off-screen content
- Explore edge computing options for faster API responses
- Consider implementing HTTP/2 server push for critical resources
