# SkillSwap Development Changelog

## April 13, 2025 - Enhanced Search & Profile Features

Today we significantly improved the skills search functionality and profile management experience. These enhancements make the platform more usable and provide a richer experience for users seeking to exchange skills.

### 1. Enhanced Skills Search Functionality

- Implemented a client-side search form component with loading states for better UX
- Added pagination for both skills and user search results
- Optimized server-side filtering for more efficient database queries
- Created a PaginationLink component to handle navigation between result pages
- Added visual indicators for search result counts in tab headers

```tsx
// Client-side search form with loading states
export default function SearchForm() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  // ...
  return (
    <Button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
      {isLoading ? (
        <>
          <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
          Searching...
        </>
      ) : (
        "Search"
      )}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### 2. Skill Categorization System

- Implemented a comprehensive skill categorization system with 10 predefined categories
- Added color-coded visual styling for different skill categories
- Enhanced the skill form to support category selection
- Added tooltip guidance to make skill entry more intuitive

```tsx
// Skill categories implementation
const SKILL_CATEGORIES = [
  "Technology",
  "Arts & Crafts",
  "Music",
  "Sports",
  "Languages",
  "Academics",
  "Cooking",
  "Business",
  "Health & Fitness",
  "Other",
];
```

### 3. Improved Skill Descriptions

- Added support for detailed skill descriptions in the skill form
- Implemented "Show more/Show less" toggles for long descriptions
- Enhanced the SkillItem component to properly display and format descriptions
- Updated the database queries to fetch and store description metadata

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

- Improved user cards in search results with better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Limited display of skills with "+X more" indicators to prevent overflow
- Added hover effects and improved button styling
- Implemented responsive layouts for better mobile experiences
- Added tooltips to "Connect" buttons indicating the feature is coming soon

```tsx
{
  user.offered_skills.length > 3 && (
    <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-white">
      +{user.offered_skills.length - 3} more
    </Badge>
  );
}
```

### 5. Profile Page Improvements

- Added better handling for viewing your own profile with special indicators
- Improved empty state handling for bio and availability information
- Enhanced navigation between profile sections with clearer headings

- Fixed the UUID error when updating profiles by adding proper validation

### 6. Authentication Error Handling

- Created an enhanced error page that provides more useful recovery options
- Implemented a forced logout route for resolving stuck authentication states
- Added more descriptive error messages for authentication-related issues
- Added visual indicators to distinguish between your own profile and others'

### Next Steps

- Implement the connection requests system (User Story #6)
- Build the messaging functionality between connected users
- Develop the scheduling system for skill exchange sessions

## Notes

The search and profile features are now complete, allowing users to:

1. Register and manage their profiles with detailed information
2. Add skills they can teach or want to learn with rich descriptions
3. Search for other users based on skill matches or user names
4. View detailed profiles of potential skill exchange partners

The next phase will focus on enabling users to connect with each other and arrange skill exchange sessions.

## April 12, 2025 - Auth System Updates & Next.js 15.3 Compatibility

Today we made several important updates to the authentication system and fixed compatibility issues with Next.js 15.3.0. These changes significantly improved the stability and user experience of the auth flow.

### 1. Fixed Next.js 15.3 SearchParams Handling

- Updated the login page to properly handle search parameters according to Next.js 15.3 requirements
- Implemented proper message parameter handling with URI decoding
- Used a type-safe approach for handling potential string or string array parameters

```typescript
// Next.js 15.3 compliant searchParams access
const messageParam = searchParams?.message;
const message = Array.isArray(messageParam)
  ? decodeURIComponent(messageParam[0])
  : messageParam
  ? decodeURIComponent(messageParam)
  : undefined;
```

### 2. Improved Supabase Cookie Handling

- Updated Supabase server client configuration to use the new `getAll()` and `setAll()` methods required by Next.js 15.3
- Added proper security headers for cookies (httpOnly, sameSite, secure)
- Fixed cookie management for better session handling and stability

```typescript
cookies: {
  getAll() {
    return cookieStore.getAll().map(cookie => ({
      name: cookie.name,
      value: cookie.value,
    }))
  },
  setAll(cookies) {
    cookies.forEach(({ name, value, ...options }) => {
      cookieStore.set({
        name,
        value,
        ...options,
        httpOnly: true,
        sameSite: 'lax',
        secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      })
    })
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Auth User Interface

- Implemented a tabbed interface to clearly separate login and signup flows
- Added password validation with real-time feedback
- Improved error messages for better user guidance
- Applied visual indicators for validation errors

### 4. Fixed Signup Process

- Improved email redirection URL handling with fallbacks for different environments
- Added more descriptive error messages from Supabase authentication
- Fixed URL encoding for error and success messages
- Added support for additional user metadata during signup

### 5. Auth Callback Route

- Created a proper OAuth callback handler to support the complete authentication flow
- Implemented session exchange for authentication codes
- Added appropriate error redirects

### 6. Middleware Updates

- Simplified route protection for authenticated pages
- Updated middleware configuration to avoid unnecessary static asset checks
- Improved auth state checking using the latest Supabase auth API

### Next Steps

- Complete user profile functionality
- Build out the skills management system
- Implement the matching algorithm for connecting users with complementary skills

## Notes

The authentication system now properly supports:

1. Email/password sign up with appropriate validation
2. Email confirmation flow
3. Login with existing credentials
4. Protected routes for authenticated users only

All error messages are now more descriptive and user-friendly, and the system is fully compatible with Next.js 15.3's stricter dynamic API handling requirements.
