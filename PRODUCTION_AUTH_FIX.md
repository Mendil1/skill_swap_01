# Production Authentication Persistence Fix

## Issue Identified

In production mode (`npm run start`), server-side pages and actions are failing authentication checks even when users are logged in on the client side. This is causing repeated login prompts.

## Root Cause

1. **Server-side session retrieval failing** in production builds
2. **Cookie synchronization issues** between client and server in production
3. **Production cookie security settings** preventing proper session persistence
4. **Static generation vs SSR** differences in authentication handling

## Fix Applied

1. Enhanced production cookie handling
2. Improved server-side session validation
3. Better error handling for authentication failures
4. Production-specific debugging and logging
