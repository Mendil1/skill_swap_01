# Database Fixes Summary - Resolving Disappeared Conversations

## Issues Being Fixed

### 1. ðŸš« Disappeared Conversations Issue
**Problem**: Previous conversations with other users have disappeared from the messages section.
**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect RLS (Row Level Security) policies on `messages` and `connection_requests` tables were blocking access to conversation data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper RLS policies for `messages` table allowing users to view messages in their accepted connections
- Added proper RLS policies for `connection_requests` table allowing users to view their connections
- These policies ensure authenticated users can only see their own conversations while maintaining security

### 2. ðŸ”” Notification Creation Failures  
**Problem**: Session-related notifications failing to create due to RLS policy restrictions.
**Root Cause**: The notifications table had RLS enabled but lacked proper policies for insertion.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "Bypass RLS for notifications" policy allowing any authenticated request to insert notifications
- Added policies for users to view and update their own notifications
- This resolves notification creation errors while maintaining user privacy

### 3. ðŸ“… Session Management Issues
**Problem**: Missing `status` columns and column name mismatches causing session operations to fail.
**Root Cause**: Database schema didn't match the application code expectations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `status` columns to `sessions` and `group_sessions` tables with proper constraints
- Renamed columns to match code expectations (`session_id` â†’ `id`, `organizer_id` â†’ `creator_id` for group sessions)
- Fixed foreign key relationships in `group_session_participants` table
- Added comprehensive RLS policies for all session-related tables

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://sogwgxkxuuvvvjbqlcdo.supabase.co
2. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. **Copy and paste the entire `database_fixes.sql` file content**
4. **Click "Run" to execute the script**

## Testing After Fixes

Run this command to test if the fixes worked:
```bash
node test_message_access.js
```

## Expected Results After Fixes

âœ… **Conversations Should Reappear**: Your previous conversations with other users should be visible again in the messages section

âœ… **Notifications Should Work**: Session-related notifications (booking confirmations, cancellations, etc.) should create successfully

âœ… **Session Operations Should Work**: Creating, joining, and managing sessions should function properly

âœ… **Real-time Updates Should Resume**: Message loading and real-time message updates should work correctly

## Key Technical Changes

- **messages table**: Now has policies allowing users to view messages in their accepted connections
- **connection_requests table**: Now has policies allowing users to view and manage their connection requests
- **notifications table**: Now allows unrestricted insertion while protecting user privacy for viewing
- **sessions tables**: Now have proper status tracking and consistent column naming
- **All tables**: Now have comprehensive RLS policies ensuring proper access control

The root cause of your disappeared conversations was that the RLS policies were too restrictive, essentially blocking all access to the conversation data. These fixes restore proper access while maintaining security.
